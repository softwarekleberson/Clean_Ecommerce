# Branch `customer` â€“ Customer Domain Management

## ðŸ“š Overview

This branch focuses on implementations related to the **Customer domain** and its main aggregates:

## ðŸ›  Implemented Features

- Updating customer data and their aggregates
- Adding and removing deliveries and charges directly in the domain
- Secure password update with validations
- Domain-specific exception handling (`IllegalDomainException`)
- Data validation via DTOs and business rules
- Unified RESTful controller for managing customer-related resources
